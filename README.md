# TravelTrends
A machine learning system for identifying patterns and trends in the travel industry.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Data on various aspects of the travel industry, including destinations, travel modes, duration of trips, and travel costs.
Machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
Visualization tools, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn.
## Installing
* Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/AnthonyByansi/TravelTrends.git
* Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data `python main.py`
* Visualize the results using the provided visualization tools.
